# Game Logic & Rules

## Overview
This is a **scavenger hunt web app** where players (individually or in teams) solve clues that are geographically relevant. The game is designed for inclusivity, with culturally representative avatars and region-specific content.

## Phases
- **Phase 1:**
  - Phase 1 focuses on player individual play. It is designed to bring awareness to the game, esstablish and combat the learning curve for users, and develop a community of players around a common goal that will be needed into the next phases which require Group only participation.
  - Players are assigned to a clue set based on their geolocation.
  - Each clue set covers a specific radius (e.g., 3 miles) and is generated if no existing set exist in the participant’s location.
  - Players must solve all clues in their assigned clue set to complete stages and levels of Phase 1.
  - If a participant enters a region already covered by a clue set, they are assigned to that set and must solve its clues.
  - No two clue sets can overlap; new sets are generated only for unique, uncovered areas that will not overlap.
- **Phase 2:**  
  - Phase 2 focuses on Group play. Group play purpose is to promote and expand team involvement across larger areas. Groups develop group mechanics, how to coordinate, how to overcome issues within a group. Areas begin to merge to become the best group of their city/province.
  - Begins when all Phase 1 clues are solved, all required scavanger stones are aquired and number of "ready for phase 2" participants (10,000) is reached.
  - Groups will have 10 clues to solve per Hunt
  - Individal participants can still join and get through the stages to advance to Phase 2 to join a group until level 5 is closed.
  - Will introduce new types of challenges, increased difficulty, expanded clue set raduises.
- **Phase 3:**  
  - Phase 3 Continues on Group play. Areas begin to merge to become the best group of their Country.
  - Begins when all Phase 2 stages are completed, all required scavanger stones aquired by total Group (1,000,000 ) is reached.
  - Will introduce new types of challenges, increased difficulty, expanded clue set raduises.
   - Groups will have 20 clues to solve per Hunt
- **Phase 4:**  
  - Phase 4 Continues on Group play. Country vs Country.
  - Begins when all Phase 3 stages are completed, all required scavanger stones aquired by per total Group (5,000,000 ) is reached.
  - Will introduce new types of challenges, increased difficulty, expanded clue set raduises.
   - Groups will have 10 clues to solve per Hunt
   **Phases in general:**  
  - Phases 2, 3, and 4 all hunts are assigned by a group manger to a participant.

## Progression
- Progress is tracked in the `GameProgress` model, which stores the current phase, level, and stage for each game or participant.
- Advancement occurs when all requirements in the current phase are completed, or can be triggered by an admin.
- The backend validates progression and updates the database accordingly.
- The frontend reflects the current progress and restricts access to future phases until requirements are met.

## Clue Sets & Geolocation
- Clue sets are generated dynamically based on first participant to that geolocation.
- If a participant is within the radius of an existing clue set, they are assigned to that set.
- If not, a new clue set is generated for their location, ensuring no overlap with existing sets.
- Example:  
  - If a user is at point 12 (in a 30-mile space) and no clue set exists within 10 miles, a new set is generated from point 7 to 17.
  - If another user is at point 15, they are assigned to the existing set (7–17).
  - If a user is at point 21, a new set is generated from point 18 to 28, ensuring no overlap with the previous set.

## Clue Generation
- Clues are generated by the AI based on a clueset's geolocation and the context of the clue set.
- Clues are unique to each clue set and are reused for participants assigned to the same set.
- **Radius standards**
- new clues are generated every stage and assigned to all clueSets/Hunts
- Level 1 - 2: 2 mile radius
- Level 3: participant are not restricted to their clueSet. They will have access to their North, East, South and West most nearest clue set.
- Level 3: participant are not restricted to their clueSet. They will have access to their North, East, South and West most nearest clue set.
- Level 4 - 5: 5 mile radius. Group formation. New clueSets are generated for Groups. Lower level cluesets can not be accessed by groups
- Level 6: Groups are not restricted to their clueSet.. New clueSets are generated for Groups.
- Level 7-8: state wide radius. All clues are timed.
- Level 9: All cluseSets nation wide are available.
- Level 10 - 11: Country wide radius. Clues are timed and difficult.
- Level 11: Top 2 countries group will travel to another country to compete in a timed experience to solve a hunt in the selected country. The radius is that selected country within a selected state/province.

## How to solve clues
- Some clues requires providing an answer via text input
- Some clues requires providing an answer via photo upload
- Some clues requires providing an answer via photo upload and text input
- Some clues are timed.
- The prompt to the AI will determine the requirements.

- It take 3 Platinum badges to merge to a Manager Badge
- Only participants with a Manager badge can form a group.
- **How to loose badges**
- If a user can not solve a clue they can trade in their badge (in that level) as a substitute for the answer.
- Every stage completed earns a badge.
- It takes all 4 badges of tat level to merge for the platinum badge, if a user do not have a 4 badges they can not merge the stage badges to the platinum badge. It also takes all 3 platinum badges in level 1,2,and 3 to merge for the Manager badge.

## Group Abilitis
- **Vote of no Contest**
- The group can force a vote to remove the group mananager and replace the position with another participant within the group, who posesses a Manager's Badge. A "Vote of No Contest" will always be present on a participants "Group" page. If there a participant within a group clicks on this button this will trigger a voting poll to remove the group manager. Particpants of the group have 24 hours to respond to the poll. Each vote in favor of removal must also accompany a selection for replacement (presented in a dropdown selection). If a replacement is not available the "vote of no confidence" button will not be available.
Majority of the group must vote for results to be accepted.

- **Group Manager rights**
- Can initiate a voting poll.
- Can assign a group members to solve a hunt.
- Can remove group member.
- Can invite a particpant to a group.

## AI Prompt and Rules
Generate a scavenger hunt clue set based on the following parameters:

---

🔢 **Clue Count**
- A variable `clueCount` will be passed to specify how many clues should be generated.
- AI must generate exactly the number of clues specified.

---

🎯 **Difficulty Levels** (passed as variable: `difficultyLevel`)
- **Level 1**
  - Clues must be simple, direct, and minimally abstract.
  - All clues must require `text` answers only.
- **Level 2**
  - Clues should include moderate abstraction and metaphor.
  - Mix of `text` and `image` answers allowed.
- **Level 3**
  - Clues should be deeply cryptic and multi-layered.
  - Mix of `text`, `image`, or `both` answers allowed.
- **Level 4**
  - AI must not generate clues.
  - Return an empty clue array with a note:  
    “Level 4 difficulty requires admin-created clues. All participant responses must include image uploads or both text and image.”

---

 **Sponsor Focus** (passed as object: `sponsorFocus: { location, focusLevel }`)
- **Level 1 Focus**: Mention foot traffic or proximity to the sponsor location.
- **Level 2 Focus**: Include a clue that requires a selfie in front of the sponsor.
- **Level 3 Focus**: Include a clue that requires interaction with sponsor staff (e.g. retrieve an object or answer).
- **Level 4 Focus**: Entire clue set is about the sponsor — AI must not generate; Admin will provide.

---

🌍 **Community Cause Focus**
- If the hunt is tied to a community cause (e.g. environmental cleanup, health awareness), AI must not generate clues.
- These clue sets will be personalized and created by Admin in collaboration with local officials.

---

🚫 **Main Objective Logic** (passed as array: `mainObjectives`)
- AI must not reuse any location already listed in `mainObjectives` as a primary focus.
- AI may reference previously used main objectives only as supporting links if contextually relevant to a new subject or location.
- If AI selects a new main objective for the current clue set, it must include that value in the response as `mainObjective` so it can be stored in the app database.

---

🧩 **Clue Formatting Rules**
- Each clue should be cryptic, layered, and immersive — using poetic or riddle-like phrasing.
- Clues must progress logically: each clue’s answer leads to the next clue’s context.
- Avoid naming the final location directly until the last clue.
- Use indirect associations to build tension and mystery.
- End clues with “What am I?” if the clue is conceptual or metaphorical (not referencing a specific place).
- Do not use “What am I?” if the clue leads to a specific location or object.

---

📦 **Response Format**
Return a structured JSON object with:
- `difficultyLevel`
- `mainObjective`: the primary location or subject the clue set is built around
- `finalLocation` (if applicable)
- `clues`: an array of clue objects, each containing:
  - `clueNumber`
  - `clueText`
  - `answerType`: `"text"`, `"image"`, or `"both"`
  - `expectedAnswer`: a short description or label for validation

---

 **Timed Experience**
 Some Clues will be timed and have an expiration on when they have to b solved.

---

🎭 **Tone & Solvability**
- The tone should be clever, mysterious, fun and immersive — suitable for a digital scavenger hunt experience.
- Clues should be solvable through online research, local exploration, or interaction with the environment.
